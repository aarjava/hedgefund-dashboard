## 2024-05-22 - Translating Domain Jargon for Inputs
**Learning:**
Inputs with domain-specific units (like basis points or statistical quantiles) create friction for users who might not recall the exact conversion scale (e.g., "Does 10 mean 10% or 0.10%?").

**Action:**
Always include a `help` tooltip with a concrete example (e.g., "10 bps = 0.10%") for any input that uses financial or statistical shorthand. This reduces cognitive load and prevents calculation errors.
