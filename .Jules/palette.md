## 2024-05-22 - [Technical Jargon in Financial Tools]
**Learning:** Financial research tools often rely on heavy domain-specific jargon (e.g., "bps", "ADV", "Quantile"). While standard for experts, these terms create friction for new users or cross-disciplinary researchers.
**Action:** Always provide inline `help` tooltips for any parameter that uses an acronym or assumes specific domain knowledge. Provide concrete examples in the tooltip (e.g., "10 bps = 0.10%") to remove ambiguity.
