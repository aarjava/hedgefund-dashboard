## 2024-05-23 - Contextual Guidance in Streamlit
**Learning:** Streamlit's `help` parameter is an underutilized but powerful tool for reducing cognitive load in complex financial dashboards. By providing inline definitions for technical terms (like "bps" or "volatility quantile"), we prevent users from needing to leave the app to look up documentation.
**Action:** Always audit sidebar inputs for jargon and add `help` tooltips where the parameter's impact might be ambiguous to a non-expert user.
