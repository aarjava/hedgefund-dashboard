## 2024-05-22 - Financial Parameter Tooltips
**Learning:** Financial dashboards often have complex inputs (like quantiles or basis points) that are opaque to non-experts. Adding `help` tooltips with concrete examples (e.g., "10 bps = 0.10%") significantly reduces cognitive load and "guesswork" for users.
**Action:** Always include a concrete "translation" or example in the tooltip for any technical or domain-specific parameter.
