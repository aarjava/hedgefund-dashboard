## Title
Volatility Regimes and Trend-Following Performance in U.S. Equities: An Empirical Deconstruction

## Author

## Abstract
This paper evaluates a standard trend-following rule (`Price > 50-day SMA`) on SPY over a 33-year sample. Unconditionally, the strategy underperforms buy-and-hold on return quality but materially reduces drawdown depth. A regime-conditional decomposition shows a clear state asymmetry: performance quality is concentrated in Low Volatility environments and degrades during volatility expansion, with the sharpest decay around the Low->Normal transition. Walk-forward, parameter sweep, transaction-cost, rebalance-frequency, and cross-asset tests support the robustness of the structural result. For broad U.S. equities, trend-following behaves more like a regime-dependent risk-allocation overlay than a universal crisis-alpha engine.
